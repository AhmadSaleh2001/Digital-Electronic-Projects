- Generate the simplified Boolean expression in its minimal form.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "Boolean_Algebra_Minimizer" folder.
3. Run the program or script associated with the project.
4. Enter the Boolean expression you want to minimize.
5. The program will process the expression using the Quine McCluskey algorithm.
6. The output will display the minimized Boolean expression in its simplest form.

## 2. Truth Table Generator and Equation Solver

### Description
The Truth Table Generator and Equation Solver project allows you to generate truth tables for equations and solve the equations based on specific inputs. This project is helpful in understanding the behavior of complex logic circuits and verifying the correctness of Boolean expressions.

### Features
- Input an equation with multiple variables and operators.
- Generate the truth table for the equation, displaying all possible combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.
- Evaluate the equation using specific input values.
- Print the result of the equation for the given inputs.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "Truth_Table_Generator" folder.
