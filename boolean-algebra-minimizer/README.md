# Boolean Algebra Minimizer

The Boolean Algebra Minimizer project is a web application responsible for solving linear equations. Users have the option to input either the minterms or the equation directly. The project utilizes the Quine McCluskey algorithm, which is known for its speed and ease of computation for computers. However, due to the numerous steps involved, it can be challenging for humans to solve equations using this algorithm

## Brute Force Solution

Initially, a brute force solution was implemented in C++ to solve the equations. This approach was capable of solving equations with four variables and ten terms, but it took approximately 30 seconds to complete. The purpose of optimizing the code and algorithm was to significantly improve the solving time.

## Optimized Code and Algorithm

Through optimization, the project achieved remarkable improvements in solving time. Even equations with 15 variables and numerous terms can now be solved in just one second. This optimization greatly enhances the efficiency and practicality of the solving process.

## React Library

The Boolean Algebra Minimizer project was created using the React library. This choice was made to ensure a more organized and structured codebase, making it easier to maintain and enhance the project.
