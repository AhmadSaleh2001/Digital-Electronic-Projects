# Truth Table Generator and Equation Solver

The Truth Table Generator and Equation Solver is a Windows Forms application developed in C#. It allows users to input equations consisting of uppercase letters and generates a truth table for the equation. The project evaluates each row of the truth table by applying the concepts of evaluating mathematical expressions and converting them to postfix notation.

## Equation Evaluation

The application takes an equation as input, where the symbols have specific meanings:
- `+` represents the logical OR operation
- `.` represents the logical AND operation
- `!` represents the logical NOT operation

The program generates a truth table that covers all possible combinations of values for the variables in the equation. It evaluates each row of the truth table by substituting the variable values into the equation and computing the corresponding output value.

## Postfix Notation Conversion

To facilitate efficient evaluation, the project utilizes the conversion of equations to postfix notation. By converting the equation to postfix notation, it simplifies the evaluation process and allows for easier parsing and computation. This approach enables the project to handle complex equations with multiple variables and operators effectively.
